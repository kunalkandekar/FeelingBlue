* INTRODUCTION
Invokes shell commands when device proximity is detected using Bluetooth RSSI.

Uses Python. Requires:
* PyBlueZ (http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/), which in turn requires...
* BlueZ (http://www.bluez.org/) 

Doesn't work on Macs because BlueZ doesn't work on Macs. Currently working on
a native Mac executable that replicates the required BlueZ functions.
